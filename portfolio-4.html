                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">Zombie Outbreak was a project created for the Brackeys “Chaos” game jam challenge by two student developers, my self and Roy Thomblison. Using the Unity engine and writing code in C#, our team worked over the course of five days to create an immersive game that challenged players to protect their troops from a zombie invasion. Despite the tight deadline, our team successfully incorporated various gameplay systems such as base building and resource management, making for an exciting and engaging experience. The project provided the team with an opportunity to learn valuable skills in game development, teamwork, and time management while producing a fully functional game in a short amount of time.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">Zombie Outbreak is an immersive game that pits players against waves of zombies as they lead a military force to construct and fortify their base while protecting their troops from the zombie invasion. With each wave, the game becomes more challenging as players gain more troops to protect and a larger area to defend. In addition to base building, players must also manage resources, repair walls, and fight off waves of zombies to ensure the safety of their troops. The game offers a unique blend of strategic planning and action-packed gameplay that keeps players on the edge of their seat. Are you ready to take on the undead and save humanity?</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">As the sole programmer for Zombie Outbreak, I oversaw the development of various systems critical to the game's functionality, including resource management, the wave system, troop system, turret system, and spawning system. Working closely with the team, I managed my time effectively to ensure that these systems were developed efficiently and within the game's scope. Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in Unity development, improving my skills in C# programming and honing my ability to work collaboratively with others. I also learned how to effectively manage my time to maximize productivity, ensuring that the game was completed successfully in a limited timeframe.</p>
